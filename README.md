# Delta 3D Printer

This 3D printer is based on the [design](http://www.openbuilds.com/builds/delta-six.476/) from Sage on OpenBuilds. Some design changes were made based on access to tools. This design is based on using OpenBuilds 20x40mm V-Slot aluminum extrusions. This has the benefit of not needing to attach an external linear rail to standard 2020 extrusions.
